Hi.  My name is Lawrence Davies.  I graduated in 2007 with a Masters
in Computer Science with an emphasis on programming.  I've been
out of the loop for quite a few years, but I like keeping track of
my Notes on discoveries regarding programming that I've posted 
on Quip over the years.

This project is basically a reference that I was able to programmatically
create to back-up and reorginize my notes.  Don't know if it will
ever be useful, but I love keeping my discoveries available for my
own personal reference.
